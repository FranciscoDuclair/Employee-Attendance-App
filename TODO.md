# Employee Attendance Platform - Development Progress

## üìã Project Implementation Steps

### ‚úÖ Step 1 - Project Setup (COMPLETED)
- [x] Create Django project (`attendance_platform`)
- [x] Add apps: `users`, `attendance`, `payroll`, `leave`, `shifts`, `notifications`
- [x] Configure SQLite DB, Django REST Framework, JWT authentication
- [x] Setup Swagger docs
- [x] Setup initial migrations and superuser
- [x] Create comprehensive README.md

### ‚úÖ Step 2 - User & Role Management (COMPLETED)
- [x] Implement user authentication (login, logout, register)
- [x] Roles: Employee, HR/Admin, Team Manager
- [x] CRUD for users (Admin can create/manage accounts)
- [x] Test endpoints for authentication and role-based access
- [x] Ensure password hashing + JWT secure auth
- [x] Create comprehensive API documentation

### ‚úÖ Step 3 - Attendance Tracking (Face Recognition) (COMPLETED)
- [x] Employee attendance check-in/out via face recognition
- [x] API receives an image ‚Üí verifies with stored embeddings ‚Üí records timestamp
- [x] Store attendance history in DB
- [x] Alternative manual check-in option for HR/Admin
- [x] Ensure recognition works within 3 seconds
- [x] Add real-time notification when attendance is marked
- [x] Location tracking support
- [x] Comprehensive attendance management system
- [x] Face recognition with OpenCV integration
- [x] Manual attendance override system
- [x] Attendance statistics and reporting
- [x] Bulk approval system for HR/Admin

### ‚úÖ Step 4 - Payroll Management (COMPLETED)
- [x] Payroll linked to attendance records
- [x] Auto-calculate salaries based on hours worked, overtime
- [x] Generate payroll reports (per employee, per month)
- [x] Admin can adjust records if needed
- [x] Export payroll data as CSV/PDF
- [x] Comprehensive payroll calculation system
- [x] Overtime management (1.5x rate)
- [x] Bulk operations and adjustments
- [x] Period comparison and analytics
- [x] Role-based access control

### ‚è≥ Step 5 - Leave Management (PENDING)
- [ ] Employees submit leave requests (type, start/end date, reason)
- [ ] Managers/HR review and approve/reject requests
- [ ] Automatic integration with attendance and payroll
- [ ] Notifications for submission + approval/rejection
- [ ] Maintain leave balance per employee

### ‚è≥ Step 6 - Shift Scheduling (PENDING)
- [ ] Managers create/manage shifts (time, date, assigned employees)
- [ ] Employees can view their schedules
- [ ] Prevent overlapping/conflicting shifts
- [ ] Notify employees of assigned shifts
- [ ] Dynamic adjustments possible by admin

### ‚è≥ Step 7 - Notifications System (PENDING)
- [ ] Real-time notifications (Django + Firebase Cloud Messaging for mobile)
- [ ] Notifications for:
  - Successful check-in/out
  - Leave approvals/rejections
  - New shifts
  - Payroll confirmation
- [ ] Allow employees to view notifications history

### ‚è≥ Step 8 - Reports & Analytics (PENDING)
- [ ] Generate admin reports for:
  - Attendance
  - Payroll
  - Leave records
  - Shifts
- [ ] Export to PDF/CSV
- [ ] Dashboard analytics (monthly stats, punctuality, absences)

### ‚è≥ Step 9 - Frontend Development (React Native + Expo) (PENDING)
- [ ] Implement mobile app with the following modules:
  - Authentication (login/register)
  - Attendance check-in via face recognition (camera integration)
  - View attendance history
  - Submit leave request + view status
  - View assigned shifts
  - View notifications
- [ ] Role-based dashboards:
  - Employee: check-in, leave, view shifts
  - Manager/HR: approve leaves, manage shifts, view reports
- [ ] Ensure smooth UI/UX with clean navigation

### ‚è≥ Step 10 - Deployment & User Guide (PENDING)
- [ ] Prepare Django app for deployment (Gunicorn + static handling)
- [ ] SQLite remains for dev/test; document DB switch for production
- [ ] Prepare Expo mobile app for build (Android first)
- [ ] Write user guide:
  - Employee usage
  - Manager/Admin usage
  - System installation/maintenance
